#liam-roll#

This repository will hold a website to use for rolling dice.
You can roll a variable number of variable-sided dice. For example, "4d6" or the sum of rolling four six-sided dice.
The website will also show the probability of the outcome.

You can also input a threshold to meet to get a pass/fail determination.
For example, "4d6t16"  will show the chance of meeting the threshold, and on click "Roll", will show whether you met the threshold (pass) or not (fail).

I plan to serve the website at roll.liamism.com.

I think I will have a ZZ
